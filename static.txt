                                                 STATIC ASSIGNMENT
                                                 =================

1) *The static keyword is mainly used for memory management in java.
   *A static keyword can be applied with variables,blocks,functions and class.
   *It is a property of a class and is used for a CONSTANT VARIABLE OR A METHOD THAT IS SAME FOR EVERY INSTANCE OF A CLASS.

    Example-   Let us suppose, we have to calculate Simple Interest of loan which is given by the government for 10 crore farmers.
    =======    Principal amount and time will be different for different farmers but the rate of interest is set by the MODI government
               which is same for everybody,say,43% per annum.

               So, we are going to have a huge data which will have one same value for interest.Hence, we have to create 10 crore instance
               variables for simple interest whose value will remian same.

               This will waste a lot of memory. So to avoid this problem,make STATIC VARIABLE for rate of interest as it's value will
               remain same and will be used again thereby saving a lot of memory space.

2) In java,class loading is the process of loading class files into the JVM(Java Virtual Machine) at runtime.
   It is responsible for loading classes from various sources,such as the file sysytem,network and databases, and making them available
   to the JVM for execution.

   After compilation of the code, the java compiler creates a byte code(.class) and then JVM(which is a part of JRE(Java Runtime Environment))
   executes the byte code with the help of Interpreter and Just in time compiler in execution engine and converts byte code to machine code
   line by line.This is how a java program is executed.

3) NO, we cannot mark a local variable as static as static variables are class variables.

4) Static block always gets executed first before the main method in Java because it is stored in the memory at the time of class loading
   and before the object creation.
  
5) A static method is also called a class method because it is a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of a class. 

6) Static block in java is used for changing the default value of static variables, initializing static variables of the class, and
   write a set of codes that you want to execute during the class loading in memory.

7)  STATIC VARIABLES- 
    ================
    *Class variables also known as static variables are declared with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or a block.
    *Static variables are created when the program starts and destroyed when the program stops.
    *Static variables can be accessed by calling with the class name.
    *There would only be one copy of each class variable per class, regardless of how many objects are created from it.

    INSTANCE VARIABLES-
    ==================
    *Instance variables are declared in a class, but outside a method, constructor or any block.
    *Instance variables are created when an object is created with the use of the keyword 'new' and destroyed when the object is destroyed.
    *Instance variables can be accessed directly by calling the variable name inside the class. However, within static methods (when instance 
     variables are given accessibility), they should be called using the fully qualified name.
    *Instance variables hold values that must be referenced by more than one method, constructor or block, or essential parts of an object's 
     state that must be present throughout the class.

8)  STATIC MEMBERS-
    ==============
    *Static variables can be accessed using class name.
    *Static variables can be accessed by static and non static methods
    *Static variables reduce the amount of memory used by a program.
    *Static variables are shared among all instances of a class.
    *Static variable is like a global variable and is available to all methods.

    NON-STATIC MEMBERS-
    ==================   
    *Non static variables can be accessed using instance of a class.
    *Non static variables cannot be accessed inside a static method.
    *Non static variables do not reduce the amount of memory used by a program.
    *Non static variables are specific to that instance of a class.
    *Non static variable is like a local variable and they can be accessed through only instance of a class.

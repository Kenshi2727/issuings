                           ===============================

1) Object creation is not enough,compulsorily we should perform initialization then only the object is in a
   position to provide thye response properly.
   Whenever we are creating an object, some piece of code will be executed automatically to perform 
   initialization of an object.This piece of code is nothing but a constructor.

2) Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to 
   current object. 
   One of the main use of constructor chaining is to avoid duplicate codes while having multiple constructor
   (by means of constructor overloading) and make code more readable.

3) No, we cannot call subclass constructor from superclass constructor.

4) If we add a return type to a constructor, then it will become a method of the class.But we use constructor
   for initialization of object.

5) A constructor that does not accept any arguments is known as No-arg constructor.

6) The main dufference between thgem is that-
   If you have not made a constructor,then behind the scene Java automatically adds a constructor during 
   runtime known as DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR.
    
                                  WHEREAS
   A constructor that does not accept any arguments is known as No-arg constructor AND IS NOT ADDED
   AUTOMATICALLY BY JAVA if you have not made any constructor.

7) *The constructor overloading enables the accomplishment of static polymorphism.
   *Sometimes there is a need of initializing an object in different ways. This can be done using 
    constructor overloading. 
   *The class instances can be initialized in several ways with the use of constructor overloading.
   *It facilitates the process of defining multiple constructors in a class with unique signatures. 
    Each overloaded constructor performs various tasks for specified purposes.

8) If you have not made a constructor,then behind the scene Java automatically adds a constructor during 
   runtime known as DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR.
   It is a zero-parameterised constructor.So, whenever you create an object and if there is a call to a 
   constructor which is zero-parameterized constructor and if there is no constructor included in program 
   ,then at that time by default behind the scene, a DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR is included(which is zero -
                                                                                          parameterised).

    Example-
    ======= 

    public class Student {
  String firstName;
  String lastName;
  int age;
  
  public static void main(String args[]) {
      Student myStudent = new Student();
      
      myStudent.firstName = "Ihechikara";
      myStudent.lastName = "Abba";
      myStudent.age = 100;
      
      System.out.println(myStudent.age);
      //100
      
      System.out.println(myStudent.firstName);
      //Ihechikara
  }
}  

Notice that we did not define any constructor before creating  myStudent to initialize the attributes created
in the class.This will not throw an error our way. Rather, the compiler will create an empty constructor but 
you will not see this constructor anywhere in the code – this happens under the hood.
